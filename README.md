# History-of-World-War-II
The Topic of this first project is centered around a dark time in the History of mankind. I decided to create this website in correlation with topics that were suggested as per our syllabus for Code Institute, that is


In this project, we are asked to try to build a static front-end website site so as to to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that we have learned about so far, that being mainly, HTML and CSS coding techniques.

In this project we try to present data to help website users achieve their objectives, or goals, (e.g.) to learn about a product, a service that the User is interested in, and/or to read, enjoy and consume information and facts that the the User is interested in finding, or using. The presentation of the web site creator's data advances the site owner's objectives, or goals, for example, it helps them to market a product, or a service that the creator can offer to it's User(s).
